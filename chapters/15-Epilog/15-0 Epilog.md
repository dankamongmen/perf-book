Thanks for reading through the whole book. I hope you enjoyed it and found it useful. I would be even happier if the book would help you solve a real-world problem. In such a case, I would consider it a success and proof that my efforts were not wasted. Before you continue with your endeavors, let me briefly highlight the essential points of the book and give you final recommendations:

* Modern software is massively inefficient. There are big optimization opportunities to reduce carbon emissions and make a better user experience. People hate using slow software, especially when their productivity goes down because of it. Not all fast software is world-class, but all world-class software is fast. Performance is _the_ killer feature.
* For many years performance engineering was a nerdy niche. But now it is mainstream as software vendors have realized the impact that their poorly optimized software has on their bottom line. Performance tuning is more critical than it has been for the last 40 years. It will be one of the key drivers for performance gains in the near future.
* The importance of low-level performance tuning should not be underestimated, even if it's just a 1% improvement. The cumulative effect of these small improvements is what makes the difference.
* There is a famous quote by Donald Knuth: "Premature optimization is the root of all evil". But the opposite is often true as well. Postponed performance engineering work may be too late and cause as much evil as premature optimization. Do not neglect performance aspects when designing your future products. Save your project by integrating automated performance benchmarking into your CI/CD pipeline. *Measure early, measure often.*
* Single-threaded CPU performance is not increasing as rapidly as it used to a few decades ago. When it's no longer the case that each hardware generation provides a significant performance boost, developers should start optimizing the code of their software.
* The performance of modern CPUs is not deterministic and depends on many factors. Meaningful performance analysis should account for noise and use statistical methods to analyze performance measurements.
* Knowledge of the CPU microarchitecture is required to reach peak performance. However, your mental model can never be as accurate as the actual microarchitecture design of a CPU. So don't solely rely on your intuition when you make a specific change in your code. Predicting the performance of a particular piece of code is nearly impossible. *Always measure!*
* Performance engineering is hard because there are no predetermined steps you should follow, no algorithm. Engineers need to tackle problems from different angles. Know performance analysis methods and tools (both hardware and software) that are available to you. I strongly suggest embracing the TMA methodology and Roofline performance model if they are available on your platform. They will help you to steer your work in the right direction. 
* Nowadays, there are a variety of performance analysis tools available on each platform. Spend some time to learn how to use them, what they can do, and how to interpret the results they provide.
* When you identify the performance-limiting factor of your application, you are more than halfway to solving the problem. Based on my experience, the fix is often easier than finding the root cause of the problem.
In Part 2 we covered some essential optimizations for every type of CPU performance bottleneck: how to optimize memory accesses and computations, how to get rid of branch mispredictions, how to improve machine code layout, and a few others. Use chapters from Part 2 as a reference to see what options are available when your application has one of these problems.
* Multithreaded programs add one more dimension of complexity to performance tuning. They introduce new types of bottlenecks and require additional tools and methods to analyze and optimize. Examining how an application scales with the number of threads is an effective way to identify bottlenecks in multithreaded programs.
* Processors from different vendors are not created equal. They differ in terms of instruction set architecture (ISA) supported and microarchitectural implementation. Reaching peak performance on a given platform requires utilizing the latest ISA extensions and tuning your code according to the specifics of a particular CPU microarchitecture.
* The previous bullet point sometimes leads to unnecessary code complications. If the performance benefit of a modification is negligible, you should keep the code in its most simple and clean form.
* Sometimes modifications that improve performance on one system slow down execution on another system. Make sure you test your changes on all the platforms that you care about.

I hope you now have a better understanding of low-level performance optimizations. I also hope you will better understand performance bottlenecks in your application. Of course, this book doesn't cover every possible scenario you may encounter in your daily job. My goal was to give you a starting point and to show you potential options and strategies for dealing with performance analysis and tuning on modern CPUs. I recognize that it is just the beginning and that there is much more to learn. I wish you experience the joy of discovering performance bottlenecks in your application and the satisfaction of fixing them.

If you enjoyed reading this book, make sure to pass it on to your friends and colleagues. I would appreciate your help in spreading the word about the book by endorsing it on social media platforms. 

[TODO]: Suggest to continue practicing with perf-ninja exercises?

[TODO]: Do I need it here? I will post all the updates and future information about the book on my blog [easyperf.net](https://easyperf.net/contact/). Post a link to the errata

**Happy performance tuning!**
